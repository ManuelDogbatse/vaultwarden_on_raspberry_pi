# Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
Setting up the Raspberry Pi is simple. Firstly, install the OS onto your Raspberry Piâ€™s microSD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager application (see [how to use Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaXWS8Lk34) for guide). I chose Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) for this project.
