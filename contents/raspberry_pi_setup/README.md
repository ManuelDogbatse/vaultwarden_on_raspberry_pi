# Setting Up the Raspberry Pi

Setting up the Raspberry Pi is simple. Firstly, install the OS onto your Raspberry Piâ€™s microSD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager application (see [how to use Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaXWS8Lk34) for guide). I chose Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) for this project.

> NOTE - You can configure the hostname, username and password, and SSH from the imager application. To do this, after selecting the OS you want to use, a settings button will appear in the bottom right.

After clicking on the button, the advanced settings will appear, where you can enable different features. I only configured the username and password for my project.

Once the OS is written onto the microSD card, eject the microSD card safely. It is very important to eject the microSD card safely, otherwise the data on it may be corrupted. 

After ejecting the microSD card, setup the Raspberry Pi before giving it power.

> NOTE - The most important thing to do when setting up a Raspberry Pi for the first time is to insert the power cable last, and put the microSD and other cables in first.

It is also recommended to buy a case for your Raspberry Pi for extra physical protection and cooling. There is a good case for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ you can buy on Amazon via [this link.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Aluminum-Ultra-Thin-Alloy-Heatsink/dp/B08BFB8QS6/ref=asc_df_B08BFB8QS6/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=658810724323&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3659962211446783774&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9044952&hvtargid=pla-1363894499759&psc=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7c2pBhAZEiwA88pOFzWT5GgPT_59DPp5gqEzLoQBbIBmA41JrAh2voncs7bLknlUxpmObBoCY-IQAvD_BwE)
